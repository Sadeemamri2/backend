## üì¶ Project Description

Hudoorr is a full-stack attendance tracking system designed for schools and educational institutions. The backend, built with Django and Django REST Framework, handles authentication, attendance logic, and database interactions. It supports three main user roles:

- **Student**: Can view their own attendance records.
- **Teacher**: Can review attendance reports.
- **Attendance Officer**: Can manage and record daily attendance, trigger absence notifications, and export data.

This backend serves as the core API service for the React.js frontend client.
